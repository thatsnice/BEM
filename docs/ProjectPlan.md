# BEM Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Bio-Economic Model (BEM) proof-of-concept implementation.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Substrate Development (4-6 weeks)
The substrate is the foundation of BEM, providing isolation, communication, and resource management.

**Goals:**
- Design and implement the minimal substrate
- Implement process isolation and basic message passing
- Develop basic token system for resource allocation
- Create logging and monitoring infrastructure

**Key Deliverables:**
- Initial substrate implementation in `src/substrate/`
- Basic process creation and management
- stdio-based message passing between processes
- Simple token allocation and tracking system
- Documentation of substrate interfaces

**Milestones:**
1. Substrate architecture document
2. Process isolation prototype
3. Message passing implementation
4. Basic token system implementation
5. End-to-end "Hello World" test between two processes

### Phase 2: Bootstrap Services (3-4 weeks)
Bootstrap services provide the minimum functionality required to enable a self-sustaining ecosystem.

**Goals:**
- Implement name service for process discovery
- Create basic reputation tracking service
- Develop persistence service for state management
- Implement time tracking and scheduling service

**Key Deliverables:**
- Implementation of core services in `src/bootstrap/`
- Service documentation and interfaces
- Example usage patterns
- Test suite for each service

**Milestones:**
1. Name service implementation
2. Basic reputation service with simple trust model
3. Persistence service for process state
4. Time service implementation
5. Integration test demonstrating service discovery and interaction

### Phase 3: Basic Process Ecosystem (3-4 weeks)
Develop a set of example processes that can collaborate to demonstrate system capabilities.

**Goals:**
- Create sample processes with different capabilities
- Implement example collaborative workflows
- Develop tooling for process development and debugging
- Test simple multi-process applications

**Key Deliverables:**
- Example processes in `src/examples/`
- Development tools in `src/tools/`
- Documentation of process development patterns
- Multi-process demonstration application

**Milestones:**
1. Process development toolkit
2. Basic utility processes implementation
3. Process debugging tools
4. Simple application composed of 3+ processes
5. Documentation of development patterns

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)
Enhance the system with more sophisticated features to support complex applications.

**Goals:**
- Implement token economy and exchange mechanisms
- Enhance security and isolation features
- Develop resource limitation and fair scheduling
- Create more sophisticated reputation algorithms

**Key Deliverables:**
- Enhanced token system with exchange functionality
- Extended security features
- Advanced reputation tracking implementation
- Resource management improvements

**Milestones:**
1. Token exchange protocol design
2. Enhanced security model documentation
3. Implementation of token exchange
4. Advanced reputation tracking algorithm
5. Resource quota enforcement system

### Phase 5: User-facing Applications (4-6 weeks)
Develop applications that demonstrate practical value to end users.

**Goals:**
- Develop demonstration applications showing practical utility
- Create interfaces for human interaction with the system
- Implement example distributed applications
- Document and package for distribution

**Key Deliverables:**
- User-facing applications in `src/applications/`
- Human interaction interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation
- Installation and deployment guides

**Milestones:**
1. User interface design document
2. Initial user interface implementation
3. Example distributed application
4. System installation package
5. Complete user and developer documentation

## Technology Stack

- **Core Implementation**: CoffeeScript
- **Alternative Implementation**: Kava
- **Testing**: Appropriate testing frameworks
- **Documentation**: Markdown
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
- **License**: MIT

## Development Approach

The BEM project will follow an iterative development approach:

1. **Design**: Create detailed specifications for each component
2. **Implementation**: Develop working code in small, testable increments
3. **Testing**: Extensive testing of individual components and integration
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of interfaces and behavior
5. **Review & Refine**: Regular review cycles to improve design and implementation

## Contribution Guidelines

- All code should conform to agreed coding standards
- New features should have corresponding tests and documentation
- Pull requests require code review before merging
- Issues should be used to track bugs and feature requests

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Process isolation inadequate | High | Medium | Early security review, defense in depth |
| Token system abuse | High | Medium | Rate limiting, careful economy design |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | High | Regular profiling, scalability testing |
| API complexity | Medium | Medium | Clear documentation, consistent interfaces |
| Reputation gaming | Medium | High | Multiple metrics, reputation decay |

## Next Steps

1. Finalize substrate design document
2. Create development environment setup guide
3. Implement core substrate functionality 
4. Design process communication protocol
5. Develop first bootstrap service prototype
