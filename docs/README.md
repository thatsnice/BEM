# BEM - Bio-Economic Model

BEM is a novel computing model inspired by biological systems and free market economics, creating a trust-minimized distributed computing environment.

## Core Concept

BEM draws inspiration from two key domains:

1. **Biological Systems:** In nature, individual cells that cannot survive independently collaborate to form larger organisms that function effectively within their environment. BEM processes are analogous to these cells, with limited individual capabilities but powerful collaborative potential.

2. **Free Market Economics:** BEM incorporates service marketplace principles where solutions compete for reputation and resources, creating efficient allocation through emergent organization rather than central planning.

## System Architecture

The BEM architecture consists of:

- **Unix-style Substrate:** The foundation layer providing a minimal but secure environment for process execution
- **Process Isolation:** Independent, constrained processes with clearly defined communication boundaries
- **Introduction-based Communication:** Processes communicate exclusively by introduction through the substrate via stdio
- **Token Economy:** Processes are granted tokens of exchange which they may include in messages to "sweeten the deal" when establishing collaborative relationships
- **Bootstrap Services:** Core functionality enabling system operation (name services, reputation tracking, persistence, time tracking, message routing)

## Key Goals

BEM aims to:

- Create a mechanism for distributing processing across potentially untrustworthy systems while constraining risk
- Enable human users to interact with each other without having to trust the computers between them more than they trust unfamiliar humans
- Foster emergence of complex, valuable services through simple cooperation mechanisms
- Provide security through compartmentalization rather than perimeter defense

## Current Status

BEM is currently in early concept and design phase. This repository will serve as the home for documentation, specifications, and eventually a proof-of-concept implementation.

## Project Structure

The project will be organized as follows:

```
docs/        - Detailed documentation and specifications
src/
  substrate/ - Core substrate implementation
  bootstrap/ - Essential bootstrap services
  examples/  - Example BEM processes and applications
tools/       - Development and debugging tools
t/           - Test suites and verification
```

## Contributing

BEM is in its formative stages. If you're interested in contributing to the concept, design, or implementation, please open an issue to start a discussion.
